# Typography

There should be a set of tokens clearly defining font sizes, line heights that can be "included" into other styled components. This should include Headings, which will add their own margins etc. This will standardise the vertical rhythm of the site. There should be no place where font-size is set manually.

These tokens can be hooked into the theme, and customised.
