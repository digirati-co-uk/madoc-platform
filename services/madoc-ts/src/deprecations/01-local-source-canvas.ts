/**
 * Local source canvas
 *
 * Previously in the Madoc database we would not store all of the information required to
 * reconstruct a canvas or manifest. The missing properties are the annotations and thumbnails.
 *
 * These properties can be derived by loading the `local_source` in the database and extracting
 * out the data. However when reconstructing a full manifest this would result in potentially
 * hundreds of files being loaded from the disk for a single request.
 *
 * To fix this, the annotation and thumbnail fields will be converted to presentation 3 and
 * stored in the database as JSON. In the future they may be broken down further to manage
 * more at a more granular leve.
 *
 * This deprecation will progressively enhance existing database entries that contain only
 * a `local_source` and not the new `thumbnail_json` and `items_json` fields. The next time
 * the local source is requested from disk, it will be loaded from disk, upgraded to
 * Presentation 3 and the database will be updated.
 *
 * New canvases imported will have the new fields and will bypass this step.
