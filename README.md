## Background

_Madoc_ is an Omeka S based platform for the display, enrichment, and curation of IIIF-based digital objects.

Check out the [Example configuration](https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/madoc-example-config) to quickly get up and running.

You can use _Madoc_ to:

* Assemble digital objects from one or more publishers and build an interpretative web site around them.
* Build your own collections from around the world.
* Enhance existing descriptions of digitised content with your own editorial content.
* Annotate digital objects from archives, libraries and museums with your own commentary, transcriptions and other material.
* Run a crowdsourcing project and invite others to contribute.

_Madoc_ is built on:

* IIIF [Presentation](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1) and [Image](https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/) APIs
* W3C [Web Annotation data model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) and [protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/)
* [Annotation Studio](https://annotation-studio.digirati.com/)
* [Elucidate](https://github.com/dlcs/elucidate-server) annotation server
* Madoc [vocabularies](https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/annotation-vocab)
* [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/)

_Madoc_ is the product of work for three projects/institutions:

* Indigenous Digital Archive: a project from the [Museum of Indian Arts and Culture](http://indianartsandculture.org/) in Santa Fe, New Mexico, funded by an IMLS National Leadership Grant and a Knight Foundation prototyping grant.
* Crowdsourcing Platform for Wales: a project with the [National Library of Wales](https://www.library.wales/), funded by the Welsh government, to build a reusable IIIF-based crowdsourcing platform.
* DARIAH-VL VRE Service Infrastructure project: [Ghent Centre for Digital Humanities ](https://www.ghentcdh.ugent.be/).


## Documentation

Full documentation for the platform can be found here.

[https://madoc.netlify.com/](https://madoc.netlify.com/)

### Installation

Get started quickly with the Madoc Platform with Docker and a prebuilt database, with our modules configured.

To get started, pull down the madoc-platform repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/madoc-platform.git
```

Move into the repository, and run

```
$ ./bin/madoc init
```

This will set up the site, you can start it at any time by running:
```
$ ./bin/madoc start
```

You should now be able to access the site at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) and the W3C annotation server at [http://localhost:8889](http://localhost:8889).

You can stop the service at any time using

```
$ ./bin/madoc stop
```

If you want to view the logs of the running containers, you can run:
```
$ ./bin/madoc logs
```

This is process is intended for local development environments only. You shold refer to our deployment documentation to install on to a server.

This software comes bundled with a helper application, `./bin/madoc` which has the following commands:


```
./bin/madoc


   Omeka command line helpers


Available commands:

  init                      Initialise dev environment
  lint-module <module>      Lint a single module
  lint-all                  Lint all modules
  clean                     Clean up, opposite of init
  git-all <command>         Run git command on all linked repos (e.g. git-all status)
  git <module> <command>    Run git command in single module
  status <module>           Git status on single module
  start                     Starts up fresh set of docker containers (detached)
  stop                      Stops all containers

Server commands:

  server-init                Initialise server environment
  server-start               Starts containers using server docker compose
  server-stop                Stops all containers
  server-rebuild             Rebuilds all containers. WARNING: deletes containers before rebuilds
  server-logs                Show and tail the logs in the server docker containers
  server-down                Bring server down and remove containers
```

#### Logging in
If you use the provided database a new Admin user will be created with the following details:
```
username: admin@example.org
password: Testpass123_
```

#### System requirements

We bundle a full annotation server into our distribution. You can change this in the docker-compose.yaml file if you need to. With the annotation server, we recommend running with at least 4GB of memory free.

## Next Steps

We would like to develop Madoc further and welcome funded projects and collaborations to add new features. 

We would like to turn our attention to:

* Integrated search using the IIIF Search API and a rich _Madoc_ advanced search API to search across:
    *  Omeka objects
    *  IIIF Presentation API resources and their metadata
    *  Web Annotations
* Better tools for transcription and integration with existing transcription platforms, handwriting recognition,  and OCR tools.
* More user interface enhancements with a wider range of viewing experiences and themes.
* Support for AV collections.
